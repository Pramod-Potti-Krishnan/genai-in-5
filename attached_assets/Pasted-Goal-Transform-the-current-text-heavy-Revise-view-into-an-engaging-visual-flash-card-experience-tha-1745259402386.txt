Goal
Transform the current text‑heavy Revise view into an engaging, visual flash‑card experience that strengthens recall through simple line drawings plus key points.

1. Top‑level layout
Topic gallery – a grid or horizontally scrollable row of large Topic Cards (one per learning topic).

Each Topic Card displays:<br>  • Topic title<br>  • Small monochrome icon or line illustration representing the theme.

When a Topic Card is tapped, it opens a full‑screen carousel dedicated to that topic.

2. In‑topic carousel behaviour
Horizontal swipe (left ↔ right) to move through cards.

Optional dot indicators or progress text (e.g., “Card 2 / 8”).

Each card must fill most of the viewport and snap cleanly on swipe.

3. Card design (inside carousel)
Upper half – a simple line drawing / icon that visually hints at the concept (e.g., a brain outline for “LLM Basics”, a shield for “AI Safety”).

Lower half – concise text:<br>  • One short headline<br>  • Up to three bullet‑points or a 2‑sentence summary.

A subtle “✓ Mark reviewed” action (button or tap‑to‑flip) to record completion.

4. UX details
On first entry, the carousel opens at unreviewed cards to prioritise new material.

After marking the final card reviewed, show a friendly toast (“Great job! Topic completed.”) and return to the Topic gallery.

Preserve swipe fluidity on mobile (use touch‑friendly gestures; no visible scrollbars).

5. Visual style guidelines
Minimalist, black‑and‑white or pastel line art for consistency and fast loading.

Maintain brand font and spacing; adhere to ≥ 44 px tap targets.

Light drop‑shadow or soft border‑radius on cards to create depth.

6. Data & state
Use the existing mock flash‑card data; add a lineIllustration field (URL or SVG reference).

Store reviewed flag per card in local storage so progress persists.

7. Out of scope for this task
No code samples or specific libraries prescribed—choose the simplest path Replit supports.

Analytics wiring and backend sync will happen in a later phase.

Deliverable: A polished Revise page where users choose a topic card, swipe through a visually rich carousel of line‑drawing flashcards, and mark each as reviewed.
