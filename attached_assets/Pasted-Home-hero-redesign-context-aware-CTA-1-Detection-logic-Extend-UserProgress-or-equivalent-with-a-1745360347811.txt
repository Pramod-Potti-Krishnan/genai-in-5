Home hero redesign – context‑aware CTA
1. Detection logic
Extend UserProgress (or equivalent) with a fast lookup:

hasStartedLearning = true when at least one audible is completed or in‑progress.

On /home loader, fetch this boolean and store in front‑end state: isFirstSession = !hasStartedLearning.

2. Hero component
Two visual modes, same component <HomeHero>:


Mode	Trigger	Layout spec	CTA text & action
Start Learning	isFirstSession === true	Large card (≥ 45 % of viewport height) occupying full width; branded illustration or looping micro‑animation; brief copy (“Pick your first topic and begin your GenAI journey!”).	“Choose Topics” → routes to Learn screen in topic‑selection state.
Next Up	isFirstSession === false	Medium card (25–30 % viewport height) with cover art, progress ring, play button. Takes more vertical space than current tiny card, sits right under Global Leaderboard.	Play / Resume the queued audible.
Component should animate height transition when switching modes (ease‑in 250 ms).

3. Visual hierarchy
Greeting banner

HomeHero (Start Learning or Next Up)

Global Leaderboard

Weekly Pulse carousel
(Re‑order as above so the large hero owns real estate near the top.)

4. Optional secondary CTA (first‑time mode)
Small link “Take a quick tour instead” under the main button → triggers existing onboarding carousel if user wants to see UI before diving in.

5. Responsive behaviour
On 320 × 568 px, hero card should not push Weekly Pulse completely below the fold; aim for 40 vh max.

Illustration / cover art scales with object-fit:cover; min‑height:140 px.

6. Analytics hook
Emit event home_hero_click with mode (“start_learning” or “next_up”) for future funnel analysis.

7. QA checklist
New signup → sees Start Learning hero, clicks CTA → Learn page opens topic accordion collapsed.

Completes first audible → reload Home → hero switches to Next Up.

Returning later → immediately sees Next Up with correct queued audible.

State persists across devices (server‑side flag, not localStorage only).

Deliverable
A conditional <HomeHero> component replacing the current small Next Up card, rendering a prominent “Start Learning” CTA on first visit and a larger, richer “Next Up” card on subsequent sessions.
