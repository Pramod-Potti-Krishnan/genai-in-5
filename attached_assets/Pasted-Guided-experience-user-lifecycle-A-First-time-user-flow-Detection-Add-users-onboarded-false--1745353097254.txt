Guided experience & user lifecycle
A. First‑time user flow
Detection

Add users.onboarded = false & createdAt fields (if not present).

Intro walkthrough

Modal or full‑screen overlay with 4–5 “coach‑marks” that sequentially highlight:

Greeting banner (“This is your personalised welcome”).

Global Leaderboard (“Track your rank here”).

Next‑Up card (“Start listening”).

Bottom tab bar (“Navigate between features”).

CTA button “Choose topics & start learning” → pushes to Topic‑Selection screen in Learn.

Skip / Next buttons on each step; progress dots.

Data update

On finishing (or skipping) set users.onboarded = true.

B. Second visit (and every subsequent)
Welcome‑back nudge

Lightweight top banner:
“Welcome back, Pramod! You’re 2 audibles away from your next badge.”

Dismissible; auto‑hides after 5 s.

Daily highlight card (Home, under greeting)

If uncompleted Next‑Up exists → show.

Else show “Recommended audible” based on least‑progress topic.

Streak reminder

If user missed a day, show a modal on login:
“Let’s pick up where you left off to keep your streak alive!”

C. Version‑based “What’s new” (optional)
Add users.lastSeenVersion string.

When APP_VERSION changes, show a quick 2‑slide changelog and update field.

D. Technical hooks
Backend

Extend User table: onboarded:boolean default false, lastSeenVersion:string.

Endpoint /me/status returning flags & next‑up audible info.

Front‑end state

On AppMounted, fetch /me/status to decide:

Show intro tour?

Show welcome‑back banner?

Show what‑new modal?

Tour library

Choose a small bundle (e.g., Intro.js, Shepherd) or custom overlay; should work on mobile.

Provide ability to revisit tour via Settings (“Replay walkthrough”).

E. QA checklist
New sign‑up → sees full tour once.

Refresh during tour retains current step.

Returning user → no tour, gets banner; dismiss persists.

Works offline after first cache (PWA).

Deliverable
Implement onboarding flags, backend endpoints, and a guided tour + welcome‑back UX that trigger appropriately across user sessions. Let me know if any additional data or UI components are required.
