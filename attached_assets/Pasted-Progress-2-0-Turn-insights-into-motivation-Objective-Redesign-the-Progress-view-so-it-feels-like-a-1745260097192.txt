Progress 2.0 – Turn insights into motivation
Objective
Redesign the Progress view so it feels like a personal “game dashboard,” nudging users to return daily and celebrate milestones. Reduce vertical clutter and surface the most motivating metrics first.

1. Hero “Scoreboard” strip (top of page)
Global Rank card – user’s percentile + upward‑arrow delta (e.g., “Top 12 % ↑2”).

XP / Level meter – circular ring or bar showing points earned toward next level.

Current Streak flame – animated 🔥 icon with day‑count (e.g., “4‑day streak”).

All three cards in a single horizontal row; tap any card → deeper analytics.

2. Quick‑stats grid (2×2)

Tile	Metric	Microcopy example
🎧 Audibles completed	“18 / 50”	“Keep the momentum!”
📚 Topics explored	“7 topics”	“Breadth builder”
⭐ Average Quiz score	“78 %”	“Sharpshooter”
🏅 Badges earned	“5 / 12”	“Next badge at 3 more”
Each tile is a tap target leading to its detailed view.		
3. Achievements & badges carousel
Horizontally swipeable row of badge icons (locked / unlocked).

Tooltip or tap reveals how to earn each badge (“Finish first topic”, “Score 9/10 quiz”).

4. Topic mastery snapshot (collapsible)
Collapse the long list into a single accordion titled “Topic Mastery”.

Inside: compact chip‑style progress bars (e.g., chip “GenAI Foundations — 100 %” with tiny bar).

Default state = collapsed to save vertical space; user expands when needed.

5. Weekly recap CTA
Sticky footer card: “🔄 View Weekly Pulse recap (2 min)” → deep links to latest digest.

Visually separate with brand colour to catch the eye.

6. Visual & interaction cues
Use subtle micro‑animations: ring fills, badge unlock pop, streak flame flicker.

Colour code: progress = brand accent; locked = grayscale; hover/tap = slight scale‑up.

Ensure every primary metric is reachable in ≤ 1 scroll on 375 px devices.

7. Data needs (mock for now)
